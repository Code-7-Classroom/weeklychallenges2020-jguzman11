// Medium Challenge

function medium(nums, target) {
    return nums.indexOf(target);
}


// var nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2];
//test
// var target = parseInt(prompt('enter a number you would like change for')) 
// console.log(medium([nums], target));

//MEDIUM: Suppose an array sorted in ascending order is rotated at some pivot unknown to you beforehand. (i.e., [0,1,2,4,5,6,7] might become [4,5,6,7,0,1,2]).
//You are given a target value to search. If found in the array return its index, otherwise return -1.
//You may assume no duplicate exists in the array.
//Hint:  Use a function. Use the built in method .indexOf( ) and/or  for loops. Review your lesson on Arrays and use the Resources provided at the end of the lesson to practice to aid in working through this problem.
